# Spaghetti Slicer

A 3D printing slicer written entirely in Rust, for desktop and server use.

**Status: early prototype. The G-code has never been run on a printer. Do not print it unattended.**

What works: STL and 3MF import (geometry only), slicing, walls, solid top/bottom layers, sparse infill (rectilinear, grid), skirt, brim, retraction, G-code for Marlin and Klipper, per-layer SVG preview.

What does not exist yet: supports, 3MF projects with settings or colours, Bambu Lab output, seam control, bridges, the HTTP server, the UI.

## Usage

Slice the bundled 20 mm cube and write one SVG preview per layer:

```bash
cargo run --release -p slicer-cli -- slice examples/cube_20mm.stl -o cube.gcode --svg preview
```

Print all settings with their defaults, to use as a starting point for a config file:

```bash
cargo run --release -p slicer-cli -- default-config
```

Use a config file and override single settings:

```bash
cargo run --release -p slicer-cli -- slice model.stl -c settings.toml -s layer_height=0.1 -s infill_density=30 --json
```

Errors go to stderr with exit code 1. With `--json`, errors and warnings are objects with a stable `code`, a `message` and a `context`:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `model.unrecognized`, `model.truncated`, `model.invalid_vertex`, `model.incomplete_triangle`, `model.non_finite`, `model.no_triangles` | The STL file cannot be read |
| `model.archive`, `model.missing_part`, `model.xml`, `model.invalid_attribute`, `model.unsupported_unit`, `model.invalid_index`, `model.unknown_object`, `model.component_cycle`, `model.too_large` | The 3MF file cannot be read |
| `settings.parse`, `settings.unknown_key`, `settings.out_of_range` | A settings file or `--set` value is invalid |
| `slicing.empty_model`, `slicing.too_large`, `slicing.nothing_to_print` | The model cannot be sliced |
| `gcode.unknown_placeholder`, `gcode.unclosed_placeholder` | Custom start or end G-code is invalid |
| `io.read`, `io.write`, `cli.invalid_override` | A file cannot be accessed or an argument is malformed |
| `model.unsupported_extension` (warning) | The 3MF file uses extensions that are ignored |
| `model.skipped_objects` (warning) | The 3MF file has objects that are not of type `model`; they are not printed |
| `mesh.not_watertight` (warning) | The mesh has open or inconsistently oriented edges |
| `slicing.open_contours` (warning) | Some layers have contours that do not close and were dropped |
| `slicing.thin_regions` (warning) | Some layers have parts narrower than the line width that are not printed |

## Reference models

`examples/` holds six generated models that print without supports: a cube, a cylinder, a dome, a tube, a stepped block and a gear with a hub. CI slices all of them on Linux, Windows and macOS and fails if the G-code differs between platforms. Regenerate them with:

```bash
cargo run -p slicer-formats --example reference_models -- examples
```

## Real-world models

3DBenchy (CC0) and its parts are used as real-world test models. They are not stored in the repository; see [corpus/README.md](corpus/README.md) for sources, license and how to fetch them.

## Workspace

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `slicer-core` | Geometry, meshes, layering, polygon operations. No file system, network or UI. |
| `slicer-fdm` | FDM toolpaths: perimeters, infill, supports, path planning |
| `slicer-gcode` | G-code generation with exchangeable flavors |
| `slicer-formats` | Model and project formats (STL, 3MF) |
| `slicer-profiles` | Printer, material and process profiles |
| `slicer-cli` | Command line interface (`spaghetti-slicer`) |
| `slicer-server` | HTTP API server (`spaghetti-slicer-server`) |

## Building

Requires a stable Rust toolchain (installed automatically by `rustup` from `rust-toolchain.toml`).

```bash
cargo build
```

```bash
cargo test
```

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
```
